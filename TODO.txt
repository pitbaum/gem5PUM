Change the ramulator code such that:
 - The scheduler will use for both rowclone and maj scheduling when waiting to aggregate the PUM commands member addresses
    - Only 2 commands need to arrive, match the requestor ID for that of the request (APA only needs to addresses)
 - Change the behavior for the scheduling that will add intra and inter bg parallelism. (If we dont use the output we dont need to add delay)
 - Change that we dont need to waste an additional clock cycle for the final commands called MAJ, FRAC, RC. (while only 1 cycle, it may scew parallelism)
 - PUM Reads should not be optimized out when going to the same addr

Change the GEM5 code such that:
 - Add the change that we use the actual requestor ID and not just 0 for package forwarding
 - We can add more than 1 channel for the ramulator DRAM
 - Check on how to skip Caches to use them with PUM
 - Make if necessary the changes to the host memory calculations for PUM
